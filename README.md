# Abstract

AutoCAD cheat sheets are a resource for beginner and experienced AutoCAD users. The cheat sheets are concise and are limited in length to ensure easy printability and convenient use. The pages were created using [drawio](https://www.diagrams.net/), and the cheat sheets are provided in PDF form. Cheat sheets are an easy resource to leave at your desk and reference in the moment without leaving your program, speeding up your workflow. The AutoCAD Cheat Sheet project is freely available and is licensed under the permissive MIT license. This project is also a collaborative open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/EvokeMadness/autoCAD-2023-cheat-sheets).
